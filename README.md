# socialdata
A repository for The DTU course "Social data analysis and visualization 02806"

The repository consists of a folder per group member for group work, and one for each assignment
Data files can be placed in the **data** folder, but will not be uploaded to git as these tend to be very large.
If you want to add a data file add the file to the .gitignore folder as `!filename.xx`
If we name files properly, we will be able to run the scripts at all our computers
